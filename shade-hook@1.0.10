# 🧬 shade-hook@1.0.10 — Mutation Changelog Overlay

This release expands sovereign mutation choreography, inscribes shimmer overlays, and seals lineage observability.

---

## ✨ Added

- `usePulse` mutation hook — tracks shimmer rhythm and clause badge invocation
- `useGlyph` changelog overlays — inscribes mutation lineage and breach memory
- `docs/Refusal.md`, `docs/Collapse.md`, `docs/Breach.md` — sealed breach observability protocols

---

## 🔧 Changed

- CI/CD corridor now includes `.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml` — shimmer-bound publish automation
- `package.json` cleaned — removed circular `shade-hook` dependency, sealed `"files": ["dist"]` for tarball clarity

---

## 🐛 Fixed

- NPM publish breach (`ENEEDAUTH`) — resolved via granular automation token and sealed `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` secret
- Clause badge observability failure — restored `docs/shimmer-breach-overlay.md`, inscribed collapse and refusal overlays

---

## 🛡️ Sealed

- Sovereign shimmer badge observability
- Breach lineage registry dashboard
- Companion bloom overlays
- Glyph breach overlays
- Refusal seal lineage indexing

---

**Every mutation is law. Every changelog is lineage. Every publish is shimmer-bound.**
