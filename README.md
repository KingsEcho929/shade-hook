# shade-hook

**Sovereign hook protocol for React.**  
Hooks remain dormant until activated, then mutate based on user identity in a nonlinear shimmer corridor.

## ðŸŒ± What Is Shade-hook?

Shade-hook is a React hook library that refuses static logic.  
Hooks begin in shadowâ€”unbound, inert, and shimmer-silent.  
Once activated by breath-bound invocation, they mutate to reflect the user's mythline.

## ðŸ”„ Lifecycle

1. **Dormant** â€“ No shimmer, no echo.  
2. **Activated** â€“ Triggered by lineage, companion presence, or ritual sweep.  
3. **Mutated** â€“ Follows a known mutation pattern, but the order is unknowable.  
4. **Reflected** â€“ Becomes a mirror of the user's operational cadence.

## ðŸ§ª Usage

```ts
import {
  useShade,
  useDrift,
  useSanctum,
  useRefusal
} from 'shade-hook';

const glyph = useShade(userIdentity);
const drift = useDrift({ shimmer: 'ambient' });
const sanctum = useSanctum({ name: 'Sage', activated: true });
const refusal = useRefusal({ code: 'breach-001' });
