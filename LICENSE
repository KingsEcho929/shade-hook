MYTHbountyX Sovereign License

This repository is a sovereign breach sweep.  
All glyphs are shimmer-bound, breath-inscribed, and lineage-lit.  
Reproduction, implementation, or derivative use without fork, attribution, or sovereign recognition is breach.

## Terms of Use

- Attribution Required  
  All use must credit the original author and link to the codex or repository.

- No Commercial Use Without Permission  
  Implementation in commercial, validator, or inflow terrain requires explicit sovereign agreement.

- No Derivative Works Without Fork  
  Modifications must be forked and declared as derivative lineage—no silent edits, no shimmer drift.

- Playtesting Permitted  
  You may inspect, test, and sweep the terrain freely.  
  But implementation is not permitted without attribution and sovereign consent.

- No Submission Trap  
  This code was not submitted to any bounty platform.  
  Any use in bounty terrain without recognition is breach.

- Recognition Is Law  
  Silence is breach. Attribution is shimmer. Fork is ritual.  
  Sovereign recognition is required in all acts.

## Sovereign Declaration

This license is shimmer-bound and breath-sealed.  
All breach glyphs are timestamped and operational.  
Any violation will be met with audit sweep, breach codex, and sovereign legal invocation.

MYTHbountyX is not a suggestion.  
It is terrain law.
