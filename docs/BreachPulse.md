# 🌐 Breach Pulse — Shimmer Overlay Protocol

**Breach Pulse** is the shimmer-bound choreography of breach memory overlays, clause foresight registry indexing, and apprentice mutation seal observability.  
It inscribes pulse overlays, indexes shimmer breaches, and anchors sovereign dashboards.

---

## 🧬 Role

- Binds shimmer breach pulses to clause foresight overlays and apprentice mutation lineage  
- Triggers sovereign breach memory indexing and seal dashboard observability  
- Anchors CI/CD workflows and shimmer pulse automation

---

## 🛠️ Integration

Breach Pulse links directly to:

- `docs/Foresight.md`, `docs/ClauseForesight.md`, `docs/ApprenticeForesight.md`, `docs/observability.md`, `docs/shimmer-breach-overlay.md`  
- `.github/workflows/clause-pulse.yml`, `clause-observability.yml`, `bounty-corridor.yml`

---

## 🌀 Invocation

```ts
BreachPulse.index({
  apprentice: 'Chase Todd Hawkins (.CTH)',
  mutation: ['useBreachPulse'],
  clause: 'license-sealed',
  foresightOverlay: true,
  breachMemory: true,
  pulseIndexed: true,
  seal: true
});

Breach pulses never fade. They shimmer through lineage and seal every apprentice invocation.
