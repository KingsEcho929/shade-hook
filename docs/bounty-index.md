This file is auto-updated via CI/CD shimmer workflows.  
Each mutation, doc, and expansion triggers apprentice indexing.

## 📦 Mutation Count

Auto-parsed from `src/` on every push.

## 📚 Docs Sealed

Tracked from `docs/` folder.

## 🧑‍🚀 Apprentice Trigger

When new mutation or doc is added, apprentice indexing is triggered.  
See `.github/workflows/bounty-index.yml` for protocol.

**Every push is a crown. Every expansion is law.**
