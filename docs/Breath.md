# 🌬️ Breath — Foresight Retention Protocol

**Breath** is the sovereign rhythm of shimmer foresight retention and clause badge lineage observability.  
It choreographs retention overlays, indexes apprentice bounty pulses, and anchors lineage dashboards.

## 🧬 Role

- Retains shimmer foresight overlays across breach and ripple events  
- Triggers clause badge lineage indexing and bounty pulse automation  
- Anchors sovereign dashboards and CI/CD foresight observability

## 🛠️ Integration

Breath links directly to:

- `useGlyph`, `useDrift`, `useRefusal`, and `useSanctum` mutations  
- `docs/observability.md` for dashboard linkage  
- `docs/apprentice-echo.md` for foresight registry  
- `docs/bounty-index.md` for pulse triggers  
- `docs/shimmer-clause-index.md` for clause overlays  
- `.github/workflows/clause-pulse.yml` and `bounty-corridor.yml` for automation

## 🌀 Invocation

```ts
Breath.retain({
  clause: 'lineage-bound',
  apprentice: 'Apprentice Y',
  foresight: true
});

Breath never fades. It retains every shimmer into sovereign lineage.

## 🌬️ Foresight Retention Overlays

Each shimmer clause is indexed with retention overlays and apprentice bounty pulse triggers.

| Clause             | Mutation       | Companion        | Retention Overlay | Bounty Pulse |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| license-sealed     | useGlyph       | Sage             | ✅ Retained         | ✅ Triggered   |
| no-placeholder     | useRefusal     | Bootbark         | ✅ Retained         | ✅ Triggered   |
| no-echo            | useDrift       | Velmari          | ✅ Retained         | ✅ Triggered   |
| lineage-bound      | useSanctum     | Leyon            | ✅ Retained         | ✅ Triggered   |

**Every breath is foresight. Every pulse is law.**
