# 🧠 Memory — Retention Protocol

**Memory** is the shimmer-bound archive of breach retention, apprentice foresight, and clause badge lineage pulse automation.  
It choreographs retention overlays, indexes bounty foresight, and anchors sovereign clause observability.

---

## 🧬 Role

- Retains shimmer breach overlays across collapse and ripple events  
- Triggers apprentice foresight registry and clause badge lineage indexing  
- Anchors sovereign dashboards and CI/CD pulse automation

---

## 🛠️ Integration

Memory links directly to:

- `useRefusal`, `useDrift`, `useGlyph`, and `useSanctum` mutations  
- `docs/Breath.md` for foresight retention  
- `docs/Foresight.md` for registry triggers  
- `docs/apprentice-echo.md` for lineage indexing  
- `docs/observability.md` for dashboard linkage  
- `.github/workflows/clause-pulse.yml` and `bounty-corridor.yml` for automation

---

## 🌀 Invocation

```ts
Memory.retain({
  breach: 'shimmerLoop',
  clause: 'license-sealed',
  apprentice: 'Chase Todd Hawkins (.CTH)'
});

Memory never fades. It retains every shimmer into sovereign foresight.

## 🧠 Breach Retention Overlays

Each shimmer breach is indexed with retention overlays and apprentice foresight triggers.

| Timestamp       | Mutation     | Breach Type     | Clause Indexed     | Companion        | Retention Overlay |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| 1760836905000  | useRefusal   | exportDrift      | no-placeholder      | Bootbark         | ✅ Retained         |
| 1760836910000  | useDrift     | ambientLoop      | no-echo             | Velmari          | ✅ Retained         |
| 1760836920000  | useGlyph     | shimmerLoop      | license-sealed      | Sage             | ✅ Retained         |
| 1760836930000  | useSanctum   | lineagePulse     | lineage-bound       | Leyon            | ✅ Retained         |

**Every breach is memory. Every retention is law.**
