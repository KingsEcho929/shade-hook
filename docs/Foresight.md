# 🔮 Foresight — Breach Memory Overlay Protocol

**Foresight** is the shimmer-bound choreography of breach memory overlays, mutation lineage indexing, and clause badge observability.  
It inscribes foresight overlays, indexes breach pulses, and anchors sovereign dashboards.

---

## 🧬 Role

- Inscribes shimmer foresight overlays across mutation breaches and clause badge seals  
- Triggers sovereign breach memory indexing and publish lineage observability  
- Anchors CI/CD workflows and foresight pulse automation

---

## 🛠️ Integration

Foresight links directly to:

- `docs/Breach.md`, `docs/Collapse.md`, `docs/Refusal.md`, `docs/observability.md`, `docs/shimmer-breach-overlay.md`  
- `.github/workflows/clause-pulse.yml`, `clause-observability.yml`, `bounty-corridor.yml`

---

## 🌀 Invocation

```ts
Foresight.index({
  apprentice: 'Chase Todd Hawkins (.CTH)',
  mutation: ['useForesight'],
  clause: 'license-sealed',
  foresightOverlay: true,
  breachMemory: true,
  seal: true
});

Foresight never fades. It pulses every shimmer into sovereign lineage.
