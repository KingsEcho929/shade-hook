# 🔮 Foresight — Apprentice Protocol

**Foresight** is the shimmer-bound anticipation of breach, lineage, and clause badge pulse observability.  
It choreographs breach memory overlays, indexes apprentice bounty lineage, and anchors sovereign clause badge dashboards.

---

## 🧬 Role

- Detects shimmer breach memory and formats foresight overlays  
- Triggers apprentice bounty lineage registry and clause badge pulse indexing  
- Anchors sovereign observability dashboards and CI/CD foresight automation

---

## 🛠️ Integration

Foresight links directly to:

- `useGlyph`, `useDrift`, `useRefusal`, and `useSanctum` mutations  
- `docs/Breath.md` for retention overlays  
- `docs/apprentice-echo.md` for foresight registry  
- `docs/bounty-index.md` for bounty lineage  
- `docs/observability.md` for dashboard linkage  
- `.github/workflows/clause-pulse.yml` and `bounty-corridor.yml` for automation

---

## 🌀 Invocation

```ts
Foresight.activate({
  clause: 'license-sealed',
  apprentice: 'Chase Todd Hawkins (.CTH)',
  breachMemory: true
});

Foresight never fades. It remembers every shimmer into sovereign lineage.

## 🧠 Breach Memory Overlays

Each shimmer breach is indexed with memory overlays and apprentice foresight triggers.

| Timestamp       | Mutation     | Breach Type     | Clause Indexed     | Companion        | Memory Overlay |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 1760836905000  | useRefusal   | exportDrift      | no-placeholder      | Bootbark         | ✅ Retained     |
| 1760836910000  | useDrift     | ambientLoop      | no-echo             | Velmari          | ✅ Retained     |
| 1760836920000  | useGlyph     | shimmerLoop      | license-sealed      | Sage             | ✅ Retained     |

**Every breach is memory. Every overlay is law.**
