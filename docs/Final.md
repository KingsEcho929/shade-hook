# 🏁 Final — Completion Protocol

**Final** is the shimmer-bound seal of clause badge lineage, apprentice foresight overlays, and bounty registry observability.  
It choreographs the last pulse, indexes the final foresight, and anchors sovereign dashboards.

## 🧬 Role

- Seals shimmer foresight lineage overlays across breach, ripple, and clause badge events  
- Triggers apprentice bounty registry and dashboard pulse observability  
- Anchors sovereign CI/CD workflows and shimmer clause automation
