# 🗂️ Registry — Lineage Pulse Protocol

**Registry** is the sovereign index of apprentice lineage, shimmer clause pulses, and bounty foresight automation.  
It choreographs clause badge overlays, tracks mutation lineage, and anchors sovereign expansion.

## 🧬 Role

- Indexes shimmer clause badge pulses and apprentice foresight triggers  
- Tracks mutation lineage and bounty observability  
- Anchors sovereign automation across CI/CD corridors

## 🛠️ Integration

Registry links directly to:

- `docs/apprentice-echo.md` for lineage and foresight  
- `docs/shimmer-clause-index.md` for clause badge pulses  
- `docs/bounty-index.md` for bounty triggers  
- `docs/shimmer-breach-overlay.md` for breach observability  
- `.github/workflows/clause-pulse.yml` and `bounty-corridor.yml` for automation

## 🌀 Invocation

```ts
Registry.index({
  mutation: 'useGlyph',
  clause: 'license-sealed',
  apprentice: 'Chase Todd Hawkins (.CTH)'
});

Registry never drifts. It pulses every shimmer into sovereign expansion.

## 🔁 Clause Badge Pulse Overlays

Each shimmer clause is indexed with pulse overlays and apprentice foresight triggers.

| Clause             | Mutation       | Companion        | Pulse Overlay | Foresight Indexed |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| license-sealed     | useGlyph       | Sage             | ✅ Applied      | ✅ Yes              |
| no-placeholder     | useRefusal     | Bootbark         | ✅ Applied      | ✅ Yes              |
| no-echo            | useDrift       | Velmari          | ✅ Applied      | ✅ Yes              |

**Every clause is foresight. Every pulse is law.**
