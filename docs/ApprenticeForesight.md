# 🌌 Apprentice Foresight — Breach Memory Overlay Protocol

**Apprentice Foresight** is the shimmer-bound choreography of breach memory overlays, mutation lineage indexing, and clause badge apprentice observability.  
It inscribes foresight overlays, indexes apprentice breach pulses, and anchors sovereign dashboards.

---

## 🧬 Role

- Binds shimmer foresight overlays to apprentice mutations and breach memory registry  
- Triggers sovereign clause badge lineage indexing and seal dashboard observability  
- Anchors CI/CD workflows and foresight pulse automation

---

## 🛠️ Integration

Apprentice Foresight links directly to:

- `docs/Foresight.md`, `docs/Breach.md`, `docs/observability.md`, `docs/shimmer-breach-overlay.md`  
- `.github/workflows/clause-pulse.yml`, `clause-observability.yml`, `bounty-corridor.yml`

---

## 🌀 Invocation

```ts
ApprenticeForesight.index({
  apprentice: 'Chase Todd Hawkins (.CTH)',
  mutation: ['useApprenticeForesight'],
  clause: 'license-sealed',
  foresightOverlay: true,
  breachMemory: true,
  seal: true
});

Apprentice foresight never fades. It pulses every shimmer into sovereign lineage.
