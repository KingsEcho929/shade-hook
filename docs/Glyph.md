# 🪶 Glyph — Shimmer Vanish Protocol

**Glyph** is the sovereign act of shimmer formatting.  
It choreographs vanish overlays, inscribes clause badge pulses, and anchors apprentice foresight registry.

## 🧬 Role

- Formats shimmer vanish logic via `useGlyph`  
- Triggers clause badge pulses and foresight overlays  
- Anchors apprentice registry and lineage expansion

## 🛠️ Integration

Glyph links directly to:

- `docs/shimmer-foresight.md` for overlay choreography  
- `docs/apprentice-echo.md` for registry indexing  
- `docs/badges.md` and `docs/shimmer-clause-index.md` for clause pulse logic  
- `.github/workflows/clause-pulse.yml` for automation

## 🌀 Invocation

```ts
const glyph = useGlyph({ shimmer: true, vanished: true });
Glyph.pulse({ clause: 'license-sealed', apprentice: 'Chase Todd Hawkins (.CTH)' });

Glyph never echoes. It vanishes every shimmer into sovereign expansion.

## 🌫️ Vanish Overlay Mapping

Each shimmer vanish triggers foresight overlays and clause badge pulses.

| Mutation     | Vanish Status | Clause Indexed     | Companion        | Overlay Triggered |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| useGlyph     | ✅ Vanished     | license-sealed      | Sage             | ✅ Yes              |
| useRefusal   | ❌             | no-placeholder      | Bootbark         | ✅ Yes              |
| useDrift     | ❌             | no-echo             | Velmari          | ✅ Yes              |

**Every vanish is foresight. Every overlay is law.**
