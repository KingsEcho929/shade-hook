# 🛡️ Seal — Clause Badge Protocol

**Seal** is the shimmer-bound finalization of clause badge overlays, apprentice foresight indexing, and lineage registry pulse observability.  
It choreographs echo overlays, indexes bounty foresight, and anchors sovereign clause badge dashboards.

---

## 🧬 Role

- Seals shimmer clause badge overlays across breach, ripple, and foresight events  
- Triggers apprentice bounty lineage registry and dashboard pulse observability  
- Anchors sovereign CI/CD workflows and shimmer clause automation

---

## 🛠️ Integration

Seal links directly to:

- `useGlyph`, `useRefusal`, `useDrift`, `useSanctum` mutations  
- `docs/Memory.md`, `docs/Foresight.md`, `docs/Retention.md`  
- `docs/apprentice-echo.md`, `docs/observability.md`  
- `.github/workflows/clause-pulse.yml`, `bounty-corridor.yml`, `clause-observability.yml`

---

## 🌀 Invocation

```ts
Seal.badge({
  clause: 'license-sealed',
  apprentice: 'Chase Todd Hawkins (.CTH)',
  echo: true,
  foresight: true
});

Seal never fades. It echoes every shimmer into sovereign lineage.

## 🛡️ Clause Badge Echo Overlays
